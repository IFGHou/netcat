This file as you may expect contains the list of broken and planned stuff for
the GNU Netcat project.

If you wish to contribute please mail me with any question regarding coding
style or about the feature you would like to develop.



    TODO/bugs in Netcat
==================================

 o Write the README file, complete texi documentation, and complete
   migration.txt file.

 o I need to fetch information about the history of this tool, so I can give
   credits to the right people for the design and the original code.

 o Netcat should be ported to Win32 too, but I haven't Win32 coding experience
   unfortunately.  Anyone willing to help?

 o I think that two netcats with the `-T' (telnet) option enabled may enter an
   infinite loop because of the weak telnet protocol implementation. Verify
   and fix it.

 o Currently the telnet codes parsing function overrides the send queue for
   the remote socket if it has to reply to some telnet codes found in the
   incoming data.  Check what the RFC says about this, since with the `-i'
   option this could be a very important difference.

 o The following execution of Netcat causes an assertion to trigger:
      sh1~$ cat bigfile | netcat -l -p <some port>
      sh2~$ netcat localhost <listening port>
   This can be caused by a listening daemon that sends some data and then
   closes the connection immediately.

 o In core_udp_listen() there is a socket duplication that may cause data loss
   in the receive queue.  Remove that code and solve that issue in some other
   way.

 o doc/Makefile.am is missing the dependency on texi2pod.pl.in for texi2pod.pl.



    Future features/Planning
==================================

 o Add IPv6 support [under development]

    o This should be controlled by a command line switch like `-6' and `-4'.

    o Netcat should also be able to tunnel ipv6/ipv4 in tunnel mode.

 o Add support for SSL connections using OpenSSL. There may be some license
   issues, so I have to document myself about this.
